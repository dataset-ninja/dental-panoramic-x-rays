**Panoramic Dental X-rays With Segmented Mandibles** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 232 images with 232 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*mandible*).

Images in the Panoramic Dental X-rays dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *Segmentation1* (116 images) and *Segmentation2* (116 images). The dataset was released in 2017 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Sharif University of Technology, Department of Computer Engineering, Iran</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, School of Dentistry, Department of Maxillofacial Radiology, Iran</span>.
